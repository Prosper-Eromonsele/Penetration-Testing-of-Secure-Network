 # Penetration-Testing-of-Secure-Network

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)
 
<h2>Description</h2>
<br>
This project demonstrates how penetration testing can be used to assess and strengthen the security of a virtualized network environment. The network is segmented into Trusted, Un-trusted, and DMZ zones, with traffic managed by a pfSense firewall.

A Production Server was introduced into the Trusted zone, and various attack simulations were performed using Kali Linux tools to test the effectiveness of firewall rules, access controls, and network isolation.

The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, validate security configurations, and ensure that untrusted actors could not breach the trusted environment. This practical test highlights the importance of proactive security measures in modern network design.

<h2>The Virtual Environment Includes:</h2>
<br>
üåê Web Server

üî• Router-Firewall (pfSense)

üñ•Ô∏è CEO Workstation and Trusted User PC

üñ•Ô∏è Production Server

üì° DNS Server

üõ°Ô∏è Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)

This repository serves as a practical showcase of secure network design, virtualization strategy, and access control implementation‚Äîideal for IT professionals, students, and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

Performed initial vulnerability exploitation on a live server using Metasploit‚Äôs msfconsole, targeting CVE-2011-2523 in VSFTPD 2.3.4, and demonstrating proficiency in penetration testing and post-exploitation techniques.
<h3>CVE-2011-2523 ‚Äî Vulnerability Overview</h3>
VSFTPD version 2.3.4 contains a critical backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) introduced in versions downloaded between June 30 and July 3, 2011. This backdoor opens a shell on TCP port 6200, allowing unauthenticated remote access to the system. Exploitation of this flaw can lead to full compromise of the FTP server, exposing sensitive data and potentially enabling further lateral movement within the network
