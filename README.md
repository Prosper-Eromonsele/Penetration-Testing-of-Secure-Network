# Penetration-Testing-of-Secure-Network
This project demonstrates how penetration testing can be used to assess and strengthen the security of a virtualized network environment. The network is segmented into Trusted, Un-trusted, and DMZ zones, with traffic managed by a pfSense firewall.

A Production Server was introduced into the Trusted zone, and various attack simulations were performed using Kali Linux tools to test the effectiveness of firewall rules, access controls, and network isolation.

The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, validate security configurations, and ensure that untrusted actors could not breach the trusted environment. This practical test highlights the importance of proactive security measures in modern network design.
